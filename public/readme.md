# Node - Express III

to create a project first, we will need to check if we have express install. TO do that we will run the following code `npm install -g express-generator`. This file will instal `exrepss-generator` globally in our machine.


After that we can run the command `express AwesomeAnswersExpress`. This command will generate `AwesomeAnswersExpress` folder that contain the express file, this command also can be used `exrepss --view ejs -css sass AwesomeAnswersExpress`


After that we will need to install `nodemon` using yarn, `yarn add nodemon` will do that for us. We will need another package as well which is sequelize the command `yarn add sequelize`. We will be using sequelize with postgres which requires a few more packages. which is `yarn add pg pg-hstore`. Also there is another command line tool we will need to install `npm i -g sequelize sequelize-cli pg pg-hstore`
